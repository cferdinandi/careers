# It's not about the technology

The most successful web developers aren't the ones who know all of the latest tools or frameworks. They're not the ones who know the most programming languages. They're not the ones who write the most elegant or bug-free code.

**The most successful web developers solve problems that make or save a business money.**

That typically means you either:

- Reduce the amount of time it takes to do something.
- Increase conversions.
- Improve a key performance metric (like time spent on site).

For example, this could mean creating a CSS framework or style guide that reduces the amount of time a development team spends writing code. Or it could mean improving the conversation rate of a web page so more people sign up, or make a purchase, or do whatever.

The most successful web developers don't just solve problems. They also talk about their work. To peers. To managers. To recruiters and interviewers. And to the public at large.

As you read this book, keep this in mind. The most successful web developers solve problems.
