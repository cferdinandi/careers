# How do you find time to build new skills?

In an industry that moves as fast as ours, it can be difficult to find time to build new skills. But it's also easier than you may think.

You only need 15 minutes a day.

If you spend just 15 minutes a day learning something new, you'll spend over a week and a half growing your skills over the course of a year. And that's only including weekdays.

## How do you know what skills to focus on?

If you're having [coffee conversations](#how-do-you-figure-out-what-to-do-next), you'll hopefully have a good understanding of what skills you need to be successful in the job you think you want next.

You can also do a search for openings for jobs you may want in the future, and dig through the job description to find out what kinds of skills and experience they're looking for.

## Open source

This how I learned JavaScript.

I decided I was going to figure out how to write a simple accordion script using vanilla JS instead of jQuery. I Googled. A lot. I tried things. Some didn't work. Some did. Some worked in unexpected ways.

Eventually I had something somewhat decent. I put it up on GitHub (which I had to learn how to do---another new skill).

Then I shared it like crazy. I wrote about it on my blog. I shared it on Twitter. I got questions from people, and feedback. In answering and addressing them, I learn more.

Then one day, Todd Motto^[[https://toddmotto.com](https://toddmotto.com/)] issued a massive pull request for one of my projects, with tons of changes and comments. I learned **so** much from having him rip apart my code.

In retrospect, I would have publicly asked for a code review way sooner.

My point is, you can work on something slowly over time, put it out there, and let the community help you learn. This willingness to teach each other is, in my opinion, one of the best things about our industry.

## Online learning

There are a ton of fantastic, interactive lessons on sites like Team Treehouse^[[https://teamtreehouse.com](https://teamtreehouse.com/)], Code School^[[https://www.codeschool.com](https://www.codeschool.com/)], and Code Academy^[[You https://www.codecademy.com](https://www.codecademy.com/)].

There are also a lot of folks who specialize in technology putting out stuff on their own sites.

Most of the lessons are short. Spend 15 minutes a day, and after a month, you'll have a really solid foundation you can build on.

## Communicating your ideas

Don't just focus on technology skills.

I've found the thing that often separates junior and senior developers is not their technology skills, but their communication skills. Being able to clearly document code and explain to others how and why something works is a critical skill if you want to move into a more senior role.

Here's a short list of things you can do to build your communication skills:

- Share code and things you're learning on your blog.
- Give a talk at a local developer event. MeetUp^[[https://www.meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com/)] is a great place to find these.
- Start a podcast (video or audio).
- Hold an internal lunch-and-learn with other developers at your company.
- Talk at a local Small Business Owners Association event. They're always looking for speakers.

A wonderful side benefit of doing these things is that you can add them to your resume and portfolio. They also make your current employer look good, so they're likely to be supportive as well.

## What about conferences?

Conferences are great. You'll often come away feeling energized and excited in a way that online learning can't replicate.

They're also a fantastic way to network. I struggle with this a bit. I'm a social introvert. I like talking, but I find large groups overwhelming. I really have to force myself to jump into conversations at conferences. But it's totally worth it. I actually landed a job that way, once.

On the other hand, conferences are expensive. And after a while, they can start to all feel the same.

If you can convince your manager to pay for you to attend, I'd recommend going to one. But if not, don't feel like you're missing out too much.

***Pro tip:*** *if your manager won't pay for you to go, you can also apply to be a speaker or volunteer in exchange for a free ticket.*
