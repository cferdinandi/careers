If you remember nothing else from this book, I hope you'll remember these three key takeaways:

1. **Talk to lots of people.** "Can I learn more about what you do over coffee, my treat?"
2. **Never stop learning.** Pick one thing to learn, dive deep, and quit quickly.
3. **Focus on solving problems.** Tasks make you an expense. Outcomes make you an asset that adds value to the organization.
