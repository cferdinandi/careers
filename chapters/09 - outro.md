# What now?

If you remember nothing else from this book, I hope you'll remember these four key takeaways:

1. "Can I learn more about what you do over coffee, my treat?"
2. Pick one thing to learn, dive deep, and quit quickly.
3. Tasks make you an expense. Outcomes make you an asset that adds value to the organization.
4. Ask for what you want. Don't tell them what you make now.
