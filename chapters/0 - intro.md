# Intro

As an industry, we spend a lot of time talking about innovative CSS techniques, the latest JavaScript frameworks, and new HTML elements. We also spend a fair bit of time talking about freelancing, how to market our services, interact with clients, and price our work.

## We don't spend a lot of time talking about being employed.

We don't talk about how to write a resume.

No one ever tells you how to answer the question, "So, what are you making now?" (Don't. It's trap designed to screw you out of money when it comes time to negotiate salary.) We don't talk about how "fun" workplaces are complete bullshit, stock options are worse than lottery tickets, or how on earth to have a 5-year plan in an industry that changes every week.

## This stuff is insanely important, but we never talk about it. I want to change that.

Before I was a web developer, I was an HR guy at a $55 billion tech company.

I used to teach engineers and developers how to find new jobs and grow their careers. A few years ago, I used my own advice to change careers, become a front-end developer, work 100% remotely, and grow my salary by 44.8%.

In this field guide, I share my inside knowledge on how to hack the hiring process and grow your career. Let's get to it!
