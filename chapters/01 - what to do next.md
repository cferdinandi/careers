The most common question I get asked is, "How do I figure out what to do next?"

If you have a sense of what you're interested in (even vague), I always recommend reaching out to some actual people who do that job and see if you can chat with them a bit. Remember this phrase:

> Can I learn more about what you do over coffee, my treat?

Some people haven't responded, but I've never had someone say no.

I've used some form of this question to chat with the CTO at a $55 billion tech company I used to work at, as well as some of the big names in web development and people I looked up to.

It's such a fantastic way to learn what the day-to-day of a role is actually like, what sorts of skills you *really* need to be successful in it, and the typical path someone might take to get there.

***Side benefit:*** *if you decide you might want to do that kind of work at some point, you now know someone who can tip you off to openings or introduce you to other people.*

## What questions should you ask?

Anything you might be interested in knowing, but here are a few to get you started:

1. How did you end up in this role/doing this kind of work?
2. What does a typical day look like for you?
3. What kinds of skills or experience does someone need to be successful in this role?
4. What industry changes do you see transforming the way this job is done?

I also recommend ending a conversation like that with, "Is there anyone else you think it might be good for me to talk to to learn more?" Keep the cycle going.

This approach works remotely, too. Coffee is a nice in-person ice breaker, but you could chat on Google Hangouts or Skype with people who don't live near you.

People *love* to talk about themselves. This is surprisingly easy to do.

## What if you have no clue what you want to do next?

If you have no clue at all what you want to do next, that's a bit harder. The blessing and curse of the web industry is just how much it changes and how many options we have.

If you're in head-scratching mode, you might want to jump start things with a bit of research.

A really easy way to do this is to pick a big conference that you find interesting, dig through the speaker list, and look at the types of places where they work and the things they do there. When you find a few that are interesting to you, do a bit of Googling to learn more about what they do.

If their work seems interesting, I would strongly recommended reaching out and using the "coffee conversation" technique to have a conversation with them.

## The myth of the "Five Year Plan."

Whenever someone asks me, "What's your five year plan?" I tell them, "I don't have one."

In our industry, a five year plan makes no sense. Things change far too quickly. And in all likelihood, your interests will, too.

At one point, I thought I wanted to manage others. Then I was responsible for a team of interns and discovered that I disliked everything about it.

Five years ago, I thought I wanted to primarily be a designer, and learned a little code only to bring my designs to life. Now I consider myself a developer with an appreciation for design, and prefer to spend my time in a text editor or browser.

## So how do you know what to focus on?

Pick the thing you think you want to do next---whether that's a particular programming language or framework, or a type of role---and focus on just that for a month or two.

Dig deep. Learn as much as you can. See where it takes you.

A very successful engineer-turned-VP at a company I used to work for referred to this as "Career Drift." Even very successful people I talked to who had planned their careers in advance found that their plans changed or fell apart over time. You just never know where something will take you.

Embrace that. Lean in.

And perhaps most importantly, don't be afraid to quit quickly. Not your job, per se, but the thing you thought you wanted to do next. Throw yourself into it for a month, and if you don't enjoy it, move on.

Life's too short. Play to your strengths.
