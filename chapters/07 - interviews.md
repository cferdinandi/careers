# How to kick ass at your next job interview

During an interview, employers are trying to understand two things:

1. Do you have the skills and knowledge to do the job?
2. Are you someone they could actually work with every day?

In this chapter, I'll show you how to do a better job with both of these.

## What types of questions will you get asked?

For most jobs, there are three types of questions an interviewer will ask:

1. **Yes/No.** Questions that can be answered with a "yes" or "no" response (more on this in a minute). Example: "Do you have experience with Sass?"
2. **Situational.** Questions that ask you how you would handle a hypothetical situation. Example: "What would you do if you needed to complete a project with a JavaScript framework you'd never used before?"
3. **Behavioral.** Questions that ask you to explain how you handled a real life situation you've been in. Example: "Tell me about a time when you had to complete a project using a new technology."

The best way to answer all three of these types of questions is with the STAR Method.

## The STAR Method

The STAR Method is an acronym:

**S**ituation<br>
**T**ask<br>
**A**ction<br>
**R**esult

To answer a question using this method, identify a Situation or Task you were in, describe the Actions you took, and then explain the Results you achieved.

**Remember, tasks make you an expense. Outcomes make you an asset that adds value to the organization.**

Use this format even for Yes/No questions. It allows the interviewer to learn more about how you work and solve problems, and demonstrates your ability to add value.

### Let's look at some examples.

#### "Tell me about yourself."

A common answer:

> I’m from Ohio but I went to school in Boston. I graduated with a degree in communications, and have been working at Animal Rescue Organization as a web developer.
>
> I like sports and my favorite food is pasta. I’d like to continue working as a developer.

Here's a better answer:

> I’m a front-end developer who specializes in responsive web design. For the last two years, I’ve been working at Animal Rescue Organization as a web developer, where I help manage their web presence.
>
> I was part of a redesign initiative to make their site mobile-friendly. As a result of the redesign, they doubled their annual donation revenue.

The first answer does nothing to sell yourself as a value-adding asset to the company. The second immediately showcases both your skill (RWD) and it's impact (doubling annual donations).

#### "Do you have any experience with Sass?"

A common answer:

> Yes.

A better answer:

> Yes. In my role as a front-end developer at Animal Rescue Organization, I used Sass as part of our mobile-friendly website redesign project.
>
> I used variables and mixins to speed up our development process and ensure consistency in design. Nesting and small, modular files allowed us to keep our project organized while managing a large stylesheet.

Again, you can see you're identifying a situation or task, talking about the actions you took, and identifying the results.

This is a great response if you have the experience they're asking about, but what if the answer is "no?" In that case, you want to answer honestly and then talk about another situation in which you quickly learned a new skill.

> I haven't worked with Sass, but I'm quite comfortable learning new technologies. Before becoming a front-end developer, I was an HR professional. By using online tutorials like CodeSchool and building a network of mentors, I was able to teach myself web development very quickly.
>
> Most recently, I learned how write vanilla JavaScript instead of relying on jQuery. As a result, my scripts have one less external dependency and load faster.

## Technical interviews

For web developer roles, there's a fourth type of interview question you're likely to encounter: the technical interview.

These are a form of quiz, assignment, or exercise designed to guage your technical ability in a more meaningful way. The problem is, many of them are bullshit.

Technical interviews typically involve answering very detailed, academic questions on-the-spot, or coding on a whiteboard or piece of paper while people watch you.

If you're a good test taker, you may actually do quite well at these. But I'm not. And they bother me, because they're not at all what coding in real life looks like.

### When I write code, no one is staring over my shoulder asking me why I did something.

My code doesn't always run right the first time. I check it in a real browser, inspect things in developer tools, and use Google to figure out something I'm stuck on.

That is totally normal.

Technical interviews create artificial pressure that by design cause people who aren't good at tests to do poorly. I'm not alone on this.

> Sometimes they would want to hear something I didn’t know. Other times I just froze on topics that I know very well. (One time I couldn’t even name my favorite video games.) Many times, I failed to perform well on some logic puzzle. Every job I actually got was because a friend made sure that it happened. For years and years I lived in fear of the interview because I knew that I’d fail.

### There's a better way to demonstrate your technical skills.

The trial assignment.

This is an approach used by companies like Automattic (the WordPress people)^[[http://davemart.in/remote-hiring/](http://davemart.in/remote-hiring/)] and Harvest (the time tracking software).

You're given a coding assignment---based on the kind of work you'd actually be doing---and then go off and complete it within a predefined amount of time (anywhere from a few days to a couple of weeks).

### So what do you do if you're asked to come in for a technical interview?

You have three choices:

1. You say "ok" and go to the interview. If you're good at taking tests or working under pressure, this may work out just fine for you.
2. You politely ask if they would be willing to give you a coding assignment instead. Explain that you know you've got the skills to do the job, but that technical interviews don't best allow you to show off your talent, and ask if they can give you a mini project to work on instead. I've never had the guts to try this.
3. Decline the interview.

These days, I would probably go for option 2, and if that doesn't work out, 3. However, early in your career, you may have to suffer through some technical interviews (or totally nail them) to get the job you want.

## How do you prepare for an interview?

There's a few simple things you should do:

1. **Study your own resume.** You want to know your own background (and outcomes) inside and out. I find myself referring back to two or three examples that best highlight the value I add over and over again.
2. **Research the organization.** Make sure you know their products or services, their business model, and any big accomplishments they've had recently.
3. **Take notes.** You'll appear more interested and engaged. But don't take so many that you stop paying attention to the interviewer. I use notes in two ways:
	- To write down questions I have so that I don't forget them and can ask them at the end when they say, "So, do you have any questions for me?"
	- As a side benefit, I cheat and write down two or three of my best work examples in the corner of the page so that I don't get nervous, draw a blank, and completely forget them.
4. **Practice.** It's super awkward, but get a friend to ask you common interview questions and practice answering them with the STAR Method. You want to have this down cold when you go in for an actual interview.

## About 70-percent of communication is nonverbal.

That means that what you say in an interview is important, but so is what you do.

Remember, interviewers aren't just looking to make sure that you have the right technical skills. They want to make sure they'll be comfortable working with you every day.

### Chimpanzees and job interviews

I have a degree in Anthrology. One of my favorite anthro classes was primatology, the study of our closest living ancestors and what we can learn about being human from them.

One thing I learned is that when two chimps greet each other and one makes a facial expression, the other will involuntarily mimick that expression.

The reason is because facial expressions and other body language don't just communicate your mood. They influence it.

### This happens in humans, too.

Next time you walk by someone, smile.

There's a good chance they'll involuntarily smile back at you. When they do, they'll feel a bit happier. This allows chimps (and humans) to communicate moods and emotions without words.

You can use this to your advantage during interviews:

- **Smile.** The interviewer will enjoy interacting with you more.
- **Sit up straight.** I tend to slouch, and need to constantly remind myself of this. Good posture conveys confidence.
- **Make eye contact.** Don't stare, of course. But eye contact is makes you appear confident and friendly.
- **Give a firm handshake.** I've had actual recruiters tell me they didn't hire someone because they had a limp handshake. Is that a bullshit reason not to hire someone? Absolutely. But it actually happens.
- **Dress the part.** For web developers, this thankfully doesn't mean a suit. But you should try to dress one notch up from how people who work there dress. If they're normally in shorts and flip-flops, wear jeans and closed-toe shoes. Not sure what the normal attire is? Call the company and ask the person at the front-desk.
- **Show up early.** I build in a 15 to 20 minute buffer for traffic and unforeseen issues. Don't go in until about five minutes before, though. Even if you tell the front desk not to, they'll call the person you're there for to let them know you've arrived, which can stress them out.
- **Shut off your cellphone.** Seriously. Shut it off. You don't want it ringing mid-interview.

***A quick but important note:*** *These recommendations are based on my experiences in North America. Cultural norms around things like eye contact and handshakes can vary around the globe, so please adapt these based on where you're based and where you're interviewing.*

### Be aware of cell-phone lag.

Cell phones have a slight lag from when a person speaks to when you can hear them. This is intensified when the person you're speaking to is also on a cellphone.

If you're using a cellphone for a phone interview, try to wait a moment before speaking.

Otherwise, you may think the interviewer is done asking their question and begin talking, and end up accidentally speaking over them. You may not even realize it, but they'll think you're rude or just generally unaware of others.
