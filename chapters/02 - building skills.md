# How to keep up

Once you're a more seasoned developer, you start to feel like you can't keep up with the pace of change in our industry.

It's driven in part by a feeling that, as an expert, you should know at least a little about everything. There's also a fear of missing out (sometimes called FOMO)---this fear that everyone will embrace a new thing and you won't and suddenly you'll be the dinosaur still using tables to design website layouts.

This is 100% normal, and you're not alone. Everyone goes through this.

## Don't expect your employer to tell you.

I've worked at a few organizations that have amazing learning cultures.

One company had weekly lunch-and-learns, where developers who worked their would talk about cool things they were doing or something new that they learned. We went to conferences. We had memberships to online learning sites.

But I wasn't told what I should focus on, or what I should learn next.

No one knows what you want for your career other than you. Make sure you're taking charge of your own learning and development. Fortunately, there are so many ways to do that as a web developer.

## Be a fast follower.

Don't be the first to learn every new technology. Don't jump on every bandwagon. You'll go insane trying to keep up.

Be a fast follower.

Wait until something shows clear signs of sticking around, and then learn it---if you're interested.

## Old technology isn't bad technology.

In fact, most businesses would rather work with old, stable, wildly mundane technology than the latest framework.

Static site generators were supposed to replace CMS's like WordPress. Sass was supposed to replace CSS. Grunt was the ultimate build tool, and then Gulp showed up.

The thing is, plenty of companies still use vanilla CSS. Many invested in Grunt workflows, and aren't going to replace them just because they're not stylish anymore. WordPress powers over a quarter of the web (and growing).

Old technology is stable. It's less expensive. It's doesn't change as frequently or break as often. It's easier to find people to work on it.

Don't feel like you always have to chase the latest thing. You can be happily employed working on more mundane technology stacks.

## Pay attention to the big shifts in the industry.

Long after responsive web design was considered a best practice, I would still run into more seasoned developers who'd heard of it but weren't really sure how it worked.

This is a really easy trap to fall into when you work as an in-house developer---especially at a larger organization. You may have a relatively stable technology stack, a pretty successful site, or even just a lot of organizational inertia and a culture that doesn't foster innovation.

I was once interviewed by the head of a UX organization who, when asked about their mobile strategy, told me, "I think mobile is a fad, and one that's time is almost up. People don't want to use [our product] on their phone."

Be aware of big shifts in the industry and how they affect the work you do and the problems you solve.

You don't want to be the one designing layouts in tables when everyone else has moved on to responsive grids and flexbox. That's a great way to make yourself obsolete.

## How do you know what skills to focus on?

If you're having [coffee conversations](#how-to-figure-out-what-to-do-next), you'll hopefully have a good understanding of what skills you need to be successful in the job you think you want next.

You can also do a search for openings for jobs you may want in the future, and dig through the job description to find out what kinds of skills and experience they're looking for.

## You only need 15 minutes a day.

If you spend just 15 minutes a day learning something new, you'll spend over a week and a half growing your skills over the course of a year (and that's only including weekdays).

So... what can you do in just 15 minutes?

### Open source

This how I learned JavaScript.

I decided I was going to figure out how to write a simple accordion script using vanilla JS instead of jQuery.

I Googled. A lot. I tried things. Some worked. Some didn't. Some worked in unexpected ways.

Eventually I had something somewhat decent. I put it up on GitHub (which I had to learn how to do---another new skill).

Then I shared it like crazy. I wrote about it on my blog. I shared it on Twitter. I got questions from people, and feedback. In answering and addressing them, I learned even more.

Then one day, Todd Motto^[[https://toddmotto.com](https://toddmotto.com/)] issued a massive pull request for one of my projects, with tons of changes and comments. I learned *so* much from having him rip apart my code.

In retrospect, I would have publicly asked for a code review way sooner.

My point is, you can work on something slowly over time, put it out there, and let the community help you learn. This willingness to teach each other is, in my opinion, one of the best things about our industry.

### Online learning

There are a ton of fantastic, interactive lessons on sites like Team Treehouse^[[https://teamtreehouse.com](https://teamtreehouse.com/)], Code School^[[https://www.codeschool.com](https://www.codeschool.com/)], and Code Academy^[[You https://www.codecademy.com](https://www.codecademy.com/)].

There are also a lot of very talented people sharing great tutorials on their own websites.

Most of the lessons are short. Spend 15 minutes a day, and after a month, you'll have a really solid foundation you can build on.

### Communicating your ideas

Don't just focus on technology skills.

I've found the thing that often separates junior and senior developers is not their technology skills, but their communication skills. Being able to clearly document code and explain to others how and why something works is a critical skill if you want to move into a more senior role.

Here's a short list of things you can do to build your communication skills:

- Share code and things you're learning on your blog.
- Give a talk at a local developer event. MeetUp^[[https://www.meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com/)] is a great place to find these.
- Start a podcast (video or audio).
- Hold an internal lunch-and-learn with other developers at your company.
- Talk at a local Small Business Owners Association event. They're always looking for speakers.

A wonderful side benefit of doing these things is that you can add them to your resume and portfolio. They also make your current employer look good, so they're likely to be supportive as well.

## What about conferences?

Conferences are great. You'll often come away feeling energized and excited in a way that online learning can't replicate.

They're also a fantastic way to network. I struggle with this a bit. I'm a social introvert. I like talking, but I find large groups overwhelming. I really have to force myself to jump into conversations at conferences. But it's totally worth it. I actually landed a job that way, once.

On the other hand, conferences are expensive. And after a while, they can start to all feel the same.

If you can convince your manager to pay for you to attend, I'd recommend going to one. But if not, don't feel like you're missing out too much.

***Pro tip:*** *if your manager won't pay for you to go, you can also apply to be a speaker or volunteer in exchange for a free ticket.*
