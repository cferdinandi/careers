# How to get paid

One area of the recruiting process that can be a real mystery is how to negotiate salary.

What if you ask for too much and they decline? What if you ask for too little and screw yourself out of money? How do you know what a reasonable salary is for the role?

## How do you know how much to ask for?

Salary varies wildly based on:

- The type of work involved.
- The size of your company.
- Where they're located.
- Whether they're a product company or an agency.

Fortunately, there are two tools you can use to get a ballpark:

1. Glassdoor's Salary Calculator^[[https://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/index.htm](https://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/index.htm)]
2. Indeed^[[http://www.indeed.com](http://www.indeed.com/)]

At Glassdoor, you just enter the job title and location and it will provide you with a salary range. At Indeed, you can search for roles by location. Many list a salary range that you can use as a baseline.

Pick a number in the middle of the range if you want to be conservative, or towards the higher end if you have a rare or unique skill you think is worth top dollar.

## Agency versus Business

A web agency---one who makes web things for other companies---typically pays less than a business that sells products or sells services that are not web development (but where you happen to be a developer).

This is a trade-off you'll have to make.

Agencies can expose you to tons of different companies and development teams, but doing high-volume work for lower pay. Businesses can often pay you much better, but with less variety.

There's no right choice. Just different options.

## Variable versus Fixed Compensation

There are two types of monetary compensation (ie. money):

1. Fixed
2. Variable

Fixed compensation is a guaranteed salary (for example, $65,000 a year). Variable compensation is typically a bonus whose amount can change based on things like individual, team, or company performance.

You may, for example, be offered a $5,000 annual bonus target. If the company hits is estimated numbers, you'll get 100% of that. If they company doesn't hit it's numbers, you may only get 85%, or none of it.

Variable compensation can be large and enticing. I personally always prefer a higher fixed compensation, since it's guaranteed money in my check every week.

## Perks

Companies will often offer perks to offset the salary they offer you. Some are better than others.

**Good**

- Health care, which is really expensive if you pay for it yourself
- Professional development, like conferences, memberships, and in-person training
- Paid time off, which costs them little but is awesome for you

**Bad**

- Stock options, which are like lottery tickets that you have to work harder for
- "A fun work place," which is often used to make you work harder and longer for less money

## Location-hacking for more money

Many web developer roles today are remote^[[https://weworkremotely.com](https://weworkremotely.com/)]. Depending on where you live, you can take advantage of this to make more money than you would working locally.

For example, San Francisco has the highest cost of living (and salaries) in the US, followed closely by New York City. If you worked in Vermont or Oklahoma, which have a low cost of living, you could negotiate a salary that's cheaper than what they might pay local developers, but higher than what you'd make where you live.

You'll probably have to travel a few times a year, but working from home and making more money are a pretty sweet trade-off for a few weeks of travel.

## How do you ask for your desired amount?

When is almost as important as how.

Most recruiters like to ask up front, and it makes sense. If you're requirements are way above the range for the role, there's no sense in moving forward. That's one strategy, and it's totally valid.

Another, equally valid approach, is to delay all salary discussion until they're ready to make you an offer. By this point, they're ideally already very excited to have you join, and may be willing to push their budget a bit to make it work.

So *how* do you ask? Just tell them what you want to make, calmly and confidently.

> I'm looking to make $65,000.

Practice saying that phrase over and over again.

You want to be confident when you say it. It should sound so second nature that you've never doubted it or considered that it could be too high.

You should be comfortable asking for money. After all, it's why you work, and your employer would have no problem paying you less if you let them.

## What to do when they give you an offer

There's a bit of a dance that happens here.

### If they offer exactly what you asked for...

Sometimes, they'll come back right away with exactly what you asked for. That likely means that the amount you asked for was too low, but you can't up your salary requirement at this point. Still, you got the offer, and for the amount you wanted. Congrats!

(*Ask for more next time.*)

### If they offer you a bit less than you asked for...

Other times, they'll come back with something a bit lower and offer some benefits and other non-monetary compensation. This means they're really interested, but are trying to get you for less money.

Always counter offer, but your personal situation will dictate by how much.

For example, if you think the role would be a huge boost to your career, or their health care package is really good, it might make sense to compromise a bit. If you asked for $65,000, and they offered you $60,000, you might say:

> Make it $63,500 and we have a deal.

There may also be a perk you care about more than money, like paid travel to a conference, or an extra week of vacation.

> Make it $62,000 and throw in an extra week of vacation, and we have a deal.

If a higher salary is your number one requirement, you might prefer to remain firm. You might say:

> While I certainly appreciate all of the wonderful benefits you have, my salary requirement is $65,000. If you can offer me that, I'll accept the job today.

### If they low-ball you...

Sometimes, the recruiter will appear taken aback by your amount. "The top of our range for this role is $55,000. Our more senior developers don't make what you're asking."

***Side note:*** *a version of this conversation has actually happened to me.*

It's likely that they're telling you the truth. If you've done your homework and know that what you're asking for is a fair price, the economics probably just don't work for their business.

You might say, "I completely appreciate that. Unfortunately, my salary requirement is $65,000, so I don't think this is a good fit. Best of luck in your search!"

Always be polite. Just because they're not hiring you now doesn't mean you won't cross paths again in the future.

## "How much do you make in your current role?"

Recruiters will often ask this question. It's even on some job applications.

Never, ever, ever answer this question. It's a trap^[[http://i.giphy.com/3ornka9rAaKRA2Rkac.gif](http://i.giphy.com/3ornka9rAaKRA2Rkac.gif)] designed to screw you out of money.

What you make today should never be a basis for what you're paid at your next job. Your pay should be based on what others in similar roles in similar locations are paid, and on that value that you add to the company.

So how do you answer this question if you're asked? By calmly and confidently telling them what you'd like to make:

> I'm looking to make $65,000.

I've never had a recruiter repeat the question after that response, though it could happen. I'd just repeat my answer.
