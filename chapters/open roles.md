# How do you find open roles?

There are three ways you can find open roles:

1. Search the job boards and submit your resume.
2. Update your LinkedIn profile and get flooded with irrelevant roles from recruiters.
3. Network.

Let's talk about all three.

## Using job boards.

This is the most common approach: you search on a job board, find roles you like, and submit your resume.

It can totally work. I got a job at $55 billion tech company doing that, and it eventually kicked-started my web developer career. But it's *really* hard to do (for reasons I'll cover in the next chapter).

## Let recruiters come to you.

If you've got a little bit of experience and any sort of web presence, you'll eventually start to get emails from recruiters about these "amazing roles" that you're "the perfect fit" for.

This is all a lie.

Many tech recruiters specialize in sourcing candidates, not technology. As a result, they don't have a good understanding of the technology they're recruiting for.

I frequently get emails for Java roles because of my experience working with JavaScript.

Sometimes a company will hire several recruiting agencies for the same role. You  might get emails about the same opening from two different recruiting firms (or from two recruiters at the same firm---awkward).

Because of this competition, they typically won't tell you who they're recruiting for. They're afraid you'll just go directly to the company and cut them out of a commission, but it means you have no way to properly evaluate the role.

As a rule, I refuse to work with recruiters who won't disclose the name of the company. Many will try to get you on a phone call before they'll tell you. It's up to you how difficult you want to be, but I insist on a company name before I'll even jump on a call.

None of this means you should never work with recruiters who contact you. But be aware of how they work, how they get paid, and the limits of what they know.

They may seem like a golden ticket, but typically are not.

## Network.

This is how I've landed every job I've ever had, with one exception. Networking is **the** best way to find a job, for two reasons.

First, hiring someone is always a gamble. Hiring someone that a person who already works for you likes and trusts is less of a gamble. You come pre-approved.

Second, the process of getting a position approved can be slow. Like, really slow. Most hiring managers don't want to wait, so they start networking with people to find candidates before the job is even approved or posted anywhere. By the time you see a role on a job board, there may already be a short list of final candidates.

Networking helps you find out about these roles sooner and get in before the door closes.

### What's the best way to network when you're looking for a job?

It works when looking for a job, too---even if you already know what the role entails and have the skills to do it.

It's just so much easier to say "yes" to than, "I'm looking for a new job. Can I chat with you about openings at your company?" It's like a magic question that gets people to open up and let their guard down.

The one difference with this approach when you're actively looking for work: ask if they known of any open roles that might be a good fit for you. If you've never done this before, it's amazing how willing people will be to help you out.

It can be a slow process, which is why it's good to start now and not when you're *actually* looking for a job.

But it works! I've landed jobs through old coworkers, someone I met at a conference, and by using coffee conversations to talk to friends of friends of friends until I eventually found someone who was hiring.
