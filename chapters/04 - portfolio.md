# Your online portfolio sucks (and how to fix it)

Most web designer and front-end developer portfolios are pretty basic:

- The name of the client.
- One or two sentences about what you did for them.
- An image or three of the website, logo, or whatever.
- Random keywords about your role. Example: "Branding, Development".

**I'm going to be blunt: these kinds of portfolios suck.**

What potential employers really want to know is how you added value for the client. Pretty pictures of your work don't tell them that.

## What you really want is a collection of case studies.

Go ahead and include images of your work. But also talk about the key challenges your client had or the big goals for the project. Talk about the decisions you made, why you made them, and how they impacted your objectives.

*What* did you do, *why* did you do it, and what was the *outcome*? You should also get quotes from happy clients and include them if you can.

Here's the beginning of a case study I wrote for PAWS New England, a client of mine:^[[https://gomakethings.com/projects/paws-new-england/](https://gomakethings.com/projects/paws-new-england/)]

> PAWS New England rescues abandoned and abused dogs and places them in safe and loving homes. They have no physical shelter, and rely on a network of foster homes to care for the dogs they rescue prior to adoption. As a result, a strong online presence is critical to their success.
>
> PAWS does amazing things, but their website and social media accounts were not. I partnered with them to redesign their entire digital communication strategy, with powerful results.
>
> **The Highlights:**
>
> - Doubled annual donations.
> - PAWS was featured in an HBO documentary about shelters and rescues.
> - Drove an additional $800k in revenue over a four year period.
> - Web traffic is up 4.7x, and mobile traffic is 27x higher.
