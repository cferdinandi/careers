The most common question I get asked is, "How do I figure out what to do next?"

If you have a sense of what you're interested in (even vague), I always recommend reaching out to some actual people who do that job and see if you can chat with them a bit. Remember this phrase:

> Can I learn more about what you do over coffee, my treat?

I've had some folks just not respond, but never had anyone say no.

I've used some form of this question to chat with the CTO at a $55 billion tech company I used to work at, as well as some of the big names in web development and people I looked up to.

It's such a fantastic way to learn what the day-to-day of a role is actually like, what sorts of skills you *really* need to be successful in it, and the typical path someone might take to do that job.

***Side benefit:*** *if you decide you might want to do that kind of work at some point, you now know someone who can tip you off to openings or introduce you to other people.*

## What questions should you ask?

Anything you might be interested in knowing, but here are a few to get you started:

1. How did you end up in this role/doing this kind of work?
2. What does a typical day look like for you?
3. What kinds of skills or experience does someone need to be successful in this role?

I also recommend ending a conversation like that with, "Is there anyone else you think it might be good for me to talk to to learn more?" Keep the cycle going.

This approach works remotely, too. So coffee is a nice in-person ice breaker, but you could chat on Google Hangouts or Skype for folks who don't sit near you. People *love* to talk about themselves. Doing this is actually really easy.

## What if you have no clue what you want to do next?

If you have no clue at all what you want to do next, that's a bit harder. The blessing and curse of the web industry is just how much it changes and how many options we have.

If you're in head-scratching mode, you might want to jump start things with a bit of research.

A really easy way to do this is to pick a big conference that you find interesting, dig through the speaker list, and look at the types of places where they work and the things they do there. When you find a few that are interesting to you, do a bit of Googling to learn more about what they do.

If their work seems interesting, I would strongly recommended reaching out and using the "coffee conversation" technique to have a conversation with them.

## The myth of the "Five Year Plan."

Whenever someone asks me, "What's your five year plan?" I tell them, "I don't have one."

In our industry, a five year plan makes no sense. Things change far too quickly. And in all likelihood, your interests will, too.

At one point, I thought I wanted to manage others. Then I was responsible for a team of interns and discovered that I disliked everything about it.

Five years ago, I thought I wanted to primarily be a designer, and learned a little code only to bring my designs to life. Now I consider myself a developer with an appreciation for design, and prefer to spend my time in a text editor or browser.

## So how do you know what to focus on?

Pick the thing you think you want to do next---whether that's a particular programming language or framework, or a type of role---and focus just on that for a month or two.

Dig deep. Learn as much as you can. See where it takes you.

A very successful engineer-turned-VP at a tech company I used to work at referred to this as "Career Drift." Even very successful people I talked to who had planned their careers in advance found that their plans changed or fell apart once they started working. You just never know where something will take you.

Embrace that. Lean in.

And perhaps most importantly, don't be afraid to quit quickly. Not your job, per se, but the thing you think you want to do next. Throw yourself into it for a month, and if you don't enjoy it like you thought you would, move on.

Life's too short. Play to your strengths.

## Be a fast follower, not cutting edge.

Once you're a more seasoned developer, you start to feel like you can't keep up with the pace of change in our industry.

It's driven in part by a feeling that, as an expert, you should know at least a little about everything. There's also a fear of missing out (sometimes called FOMO)---this fear that everyone will embrace a knew thing and you won't and suddenly you'll be the dinosaur still using tables to design website layouts.

This is 100% normal, and you're not alone. Everyone goes through this.

Also, don't be the first to get into a new technology. Don't jump on every bandwagon. You'll go insane trying to keep up.

Be a fast follower. Wait until something shows clear signs of sticking around, and then learn it---if you're interested.

## Old technology isn't bad technology.

In fact, most businesses would rather work with old, stable, wildly mundane technology than the latest framework.

Static site generators were supposed to replace CMS's like WordPress. Sass was supposed to replace CSS. Grunt was the ultimate build tool, and then Gulp showed up.

The thing is, plenty of companies still use vanilla CSS. Many invested in Grunt workflows, and aren't going to replace them just because they're not stylish anymore. WordPress powers over a quarter of the web (and growing).

Old technology is stable. It's less expensive. It's doesn't change as frequently or break as often. It's easier to find people to work on it.

Don't feel like you always have to chase the latest thing. You can be happily employed working on more mundane technology stacks.
