<span class="text-large">No one ever teaches you how to have a successful career.</span>

How do you write a resume that actually gets looked at? How do you answer the question, "So, how much are you making now?" How do you negotiate a salary? How on earth do you have a 5-year plan in an industry that changes every week.

In *The Web Developer Career Guide*, I answer these questions and more.
